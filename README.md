# Zen Linux &nbsp; [![build-ublue](https://github.com/blue-build/template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blue-build/template/actions/workflows/build.yml)

See the [BlueBuild docs](https://blue-build.org/how-to/setup/). 

## Installation (ISO) [Recommended]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Backup your important data before proceeding with the installation.

> [!CAUTION]
> This ISO installation guide assumes that you want to install Zen Linux on single-boot single-disk setup.

### [DOWNLOAD LINK](https://github.com/mecattaf/zen/actions/workflows/build-iso.yml)
Click on the most recent successful build, then download the ISO artifact.  
ISOs are named in DD-MM-YYYY date format for easy identification.

- Download and extract the ISO artifact from GitHub Actions
- ISO doesn't require an active internet connection during its usage (but it is recommended to have it for NTP functionality)
- Boot from the ISO and proceed with installation
- When ISO is booted, complete the following mandatory configuration:
  - **Network & Host Name**: Configure your WiFi connection if needed
  - **Installation Destination**: Select target disk, choose "Storage Configuration" → Automatic, then "Free up space by removing or shrinking existing partitions"
    - When "Reclaim disk space" screen appears, click "Delete all" and "Reclaim space"
  - **User Creation**: Input your full name, username, and password. Click Done.
  - **Root Password**: Set a root password for system administration (recommended for Sway environments)
- Optionally configure "Keyboard", "Language Support", "Time & Date", etc.
- Click "Begin Installation"
- After installation completes, reboot and enjoy your new Zen Linux system

### Post-Installation Notes

After first boot, your Sway environment will be ready to use with all configured dotfiles and packages. The system will automatically apply your chezmoi configuration, so your personalized environment should be available within a few minutes of first login.

## Installation (Rebase)

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/mecattaf/zen:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/mecattaf/zen:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

### Manual Steps

- Copy over git credentials
- Authenticate to google chrome and [follow instructions](docs/chrome.md)
- Authenticate to gh from the CLI
- We also make sure to add python packages install through uv, add to justfile:
```
uv tool install --force --python python3.12 aider-chat@latest
```

### Troubleshooting flatpaks

If a flatpak is broken, revert versions using:
```
flatpak list
flatpak remote-info --log flathub com.google.Chrome
flatpak update --commit=<commit-of-working-version> com.google.Chrome
```

### Rolling back to previous versions

View the list of available builds by entering:
```
skopeo list-tags docker://ghcr.io/mecattaf/zen | sort -rV
```

Rebasing to a specific build requires users to open a host terminal and enter:
```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/IMAGE-NAME:VERSION-YEARMONTHDAY
```

Example:
```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-deck:39-20240113
```
For the Jan. 13th 2024 bazzite-deck (Fedora 39) build.

### To revert back to Silverblue

```shell
sudo rpm-ostree rebase fedora:fedora/40/x86_64/silverblue
```
